# 📊 Nexus Book Cards — Interactive Stats UI Resource

A **reusable front-end UI resource** for interactive book cards with animated statistics.  
Built as a library-style component to showcase books with micro-interactions, card highlighting, and dynamic progress bars.

This is intended as a **UI pattern / reusable resource**, not a complete product.


## ✨ Features

- Animated hero section with title, subtitle, and CTA toggle
- Interactive book cards with hover and active states
- Click-to-display animated statistics panel
- Smooth progress bar animations for multiple metrics
- Toggle to show/hide statistics
- Vanilla JS + Anime.js for timeline animations
- Fully responsive layout
- Modular, reusable components (cards, toggle, stats panel)


## 🛠 Technologies

- HTML5  
- CSS3 (Flexbox, transitions, custom styling)  
- JavaScript (ES6+)  
- [Anime.js](https://animejs.com/) for animations  


## 🌱 What I Learned

While creating this UI resource, I improved my understanding of:

- Building reusable interactive components (cards, toggles, progress bars)
- Sequencing animations with Anime.js timelines
- Coordinating multiple animated elements in response to user interaction
- Managing active states and toggles in vanilla JavaScript
- Styling dynamic content with CSS transitions and transforms
- Structuring a hero section with layered interactions
- Building UI patterns that can be reused across projects

This project reinforced the connection between **UX design, visual storytelling, and front-end logic** in interactive interfaces.


## 📍 The Process

This resource was built as a **library-style UI component** to:

- Highlight multiple book cards with subtle 3D effects
- Show statistics only when requested by the user
- Animate progress bars and panel visibility in response to interactions
- Ensure all animations are smooth, coordinated, and visually appealing

Focus was placed on **reusability**, accessibility, and clean code rather than a full application.
